            Idaho is a beautiful state. It is known for its agricultural production. Idaho produces much of the worlds corn seed, and is especially known for growing potatoes.
            Sometimes Idaho is referred to as the United States' best kept secret. Some of my favorite places on earth are here in Idaho.
